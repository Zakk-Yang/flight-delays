## Motivation

I realize that flying and/or travelling is not what is most present on people minds at this time. But I'm getting tired of hearing about what we can and cannot do. We are going to be fine, and life will eventually go back to normal. In that spirit I wanted to make a tool for the curious traveler. You know the one that loves every single detail of a trip.
